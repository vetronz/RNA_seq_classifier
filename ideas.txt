general overview
need more agnostic gene selection process to as to use for publication narative
this can be achieved by using a HC vs all disease groups rather than multiple comparisons
(Bct + greyb + greyv + virl + OD)/5 - HC
this constructs a contrast matrix of disease vs HC where each disease contrbutes a portion to the comparison rather than the multiple 1 vs 1 comparison)

this means the narative of your work has a disease agnostic component
this means you dont get penalized by reviews saying of course you found that the clusters formed bct and vrl groups becuase you included genes that were
sig differentiially expressed between those groups!

however you still need to pair down some of the dimensionality of the gene expression data somehow without inviting this criticism.

myrsinis idea is to use the above method to construct the contrast matrix and then combine this with a lenient p value and lfc so as to reduce dimensionality
in a class agnostic manner.
This means any results of clustering are purly becuase of real bio effect rather than because you are feeding the algo genes that are known to be sig.

once you have used the healthy controls to construct the diff genes you can eliminate them from the clustering process as they will muddy the waters.


boxplot inflam markers by cluster rather than by diagnostic group will make your point clearer.

barplot of cluster with pathogen found proportions would be interesting

t sne plots (perplexity)

sweeney sepsis signature: could look at how this validates aginst our group.




Myrsini long term view.

data is out there.
construct unsupervised clustering groups using disease agnostic groups from the above contrast matrix.
check for effect within clusters either in terms of gram +ve gram -ve or pathogen or site infected

then validate in validation cohort.
