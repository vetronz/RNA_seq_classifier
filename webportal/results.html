                            <!-- <p>The results of K-means clustering with 2 clusters is showin in Figure XYZ below. Cluster one has a higher percentage of bacterial and probable bacterial cases with 32 of 51 bacterial cases and 23 of 42 probable bacterial cases. Unknown cases were split evenly between the 2 clusters. The majority of viral cases, 65 of 92, were assigned to cluster 2 wuth just 27 being assinged to cluster 1. Figure XYZ shows the inflamamatory marker breakdown by cluster. Cluster 1 had a higher median WBC count and a higher CRP relative to cluster 2. This is unsuprising given that we known from Figure previous XYZ that cluster one had a higher number of bacterial cases and bacterial cases tend to have higher inflamatory markers. However if we examine the inflammatory marker distributions exclusivly within the 51 bacterial cases seen in Figure XYZ we see that this effect is preserved. Bacterial cases assigned to cluster 1 had significantly higher WBC and CRP counts than bacterial cases assigned to cluster 2. This is interesting becuase it implies that not all bacterial infections behave similarly at a global transcriptomic level.</p>

                                    <p>In order to further investigate why the bacterial cases had been partioned into these groups I have plotted the organ system that the infection was affecting for each of the bacterial cases assigned to the 2 clusters in Figure XYZ below.</p>
                                    <p>All 3 of the patients suffering with intra-abdominal infections were assinged to cluster 1. Of 16 bacteraemic patients (patients with a pathogen detected in the blood stream) 12 were assigned to cluster 1 compared to 4 to cluster 2. Infections affecting the central nervous system (CNS) such as meningitis and encephalitis were evenly split proportionally between the two clusters  with 9 assigned to cluster 1 and 6 assigned to cluster 2. Of 9 respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, 6 were assigned to cluster 1 and 3 to cluster 2. Of 6 soft tissue infections 2 were assigned to cluster 2 and 4 were assinged to cluster 2. There were 2 cases assinged to cluster 2 with no evident causative organ system involvement. Patients assinged to the bacterial diagnostic group, by definition, had to have a positive bacterial culture. This meant the pathogen causing the infection had been identified. Figure XYZ shows the cluster breakdowns by the causative pathogen. The pathogens were fairly evenly distributed between the two groups with the exception of infections caused by meningococcus 14 of which were assigned to cluster 1 and 3 to cluster 2. These account for the discrepancy in the bacteraemic patients between the two clusters as the majority of patients affected with meningococcus presented with bacteraemia.</p>

                                        We can see that of 14 meningococcal infections assigned to cluster 1 only 2 can co-infection with a virus. By contrast 2 of the 3 meningococcal cases assigned to cluster 2 had a viral co-infection. The third meningococcal case assigned to cluster 2 had G1* coded  as the Path_2 for which I could not find a key. However it is possible that this third case also was co-infected with an unknown pathogen. </p>

                                    <p>Patients with bacterial infection will normally have higher neutrophil counts relative lymphocytes. By contrast patients with viral infections will normally have higher lymphocyte counts. Figure XYZ shows the neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages for bacterial cases assigned to each class. Note that other cell types not included here contrbute to the overall white blood cell count and therefore the sum of neutrophil and lymphocyte percentage need not equal 100%. We can see that bacterial cases assigned to cluster 1 had a higher neutrophil percentage in their white blood cells relative to lymphocytes. This tred was reversed for bacterial cases assigned to cluster 2.</p>

                            <p>The result of clustering into 4 clusters is shown below in Figure XYZ. The majority of cases assigned to cluster 1 are viral accounting for 35 of 68 cases in that cluster. Cluster 2 was predominantly bacterial with 28 of the 51 bacterial cases and 10 of the 42 probable bacterial cases assigned to it. Cluster 3 was more heterogenious with 20 viral cases, 21 unknowns 14 probable bacterials and just 5 bacterials. Cluster 4 was predominatly viral 30 viral cases out of 58 total cases assigned to the cluster.</p>
                            <p>

                            In Figure XYZ we see the same pattern as we observed for the case with K=2 where by cluster 2 with a higher bacterial burden had higher inflammatory markers.
                            To understand why the bacterial cases were separated between clusters I have plotted the inflammatory markers looking exclusively at the 51 bacterial cases in Figure XYZ.
                            We can see from this that the bacterial cases appear to have been partitioned on the basis of the inflammatory markers with the more severe infections with higher inflamamatory markers being assigned to cluster 2.

                                    <p>Figure XYZ.1 and .2 show the organ system involvement for each cluster and the pathogenic organism detected. We see the same effect as was present in the K=2 case where by a higher proportion of bacteraemic cases were assigned to cluster 2. The causative pathogen in the majority of these cases was meningococcus as seen in Figure XYZ.2.
                                    However not all of the meningococcal cases were assigned to cluster 2. Clusters 1 and 4 both had a single meningococcal patient and cluster 3 had 2.
                                    To better understand why these cases were  split from the main body of meningococcal cases who were assigned to cluster 2 I have presented Table XYZ below which details the clinical summary for all of the meningococcal patients.
                                    The K2_Cluster and K4_Cluster columns detail the cluster assignement for the k=2 and k=4 cases respectively. It is interesting to note that the outlier meningococcal cases 15, 16 and 17 that were the only cases assigned to cluster 2 have also been isolated to distinct clusters in the K=4 case with 2 assigned to cluster 3 and 1 assigned to its own cluster 4. </p>

                                            To visualize why these cases have been partitioned from the bulk of the meningococcal cases I have plotted in Figure XYZ a 2 dimensional PCA plot. The 4 colours indicate the cluster assignment and the crosses are meningococcal cases. We can see the bulk of the cases are relatively closely clusterd and have been assigned to cluster 2. However zooming in over the 0, 0 coordinate we can see the 2 meningococcal cases assigned to cluster 3 and the case assigned to cluster 4. It is likely that co-infection with viral or other pathogens have distorted the characteristic meningococcal transcriptomic signature and pulled these cases into other clusters.
