pca prop var explained


color pca based on more variables - viral co-infection


unsupervised clustering (include all genes not only those sig diff bct-vrl)
between the 4 groups.
Similar results to with bct-vrl top diff genes?

Do
unsupervised clustering of 5 groups

unsupervised clustering of bacterial and greyb to
whether similar groups emerge as with supervised clustering 
do the same portion of grey b partition off with the bacs as shown in 
the supervised clustering.

more comparisons to see whether same clustering
viral vs control
bacterial vs control
